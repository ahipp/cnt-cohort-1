# cnt-cohort-1
Demo site of minimum viable product for CNT tech challenge cohort #1. For more info about what that is, see http://www.cnt.org/tech-challenge

This codebase is to create a basic UI which can be used to demo the results of multiple regression analysis on industrial sales data. The idea is for this to be a basis for a product which can help the process of connecting industrial site buyers with available locations. For the demo, specific results of the analysis are uploaded as CSVs and accessed by GET calls.

To run locally on your environment:

Must have NodeJS and Node Package Manager installed

Execute "npm run app" to start up the server, listening on port 3000

Accessing localhost:3000 in a browser should bring up the site when the app is listening
